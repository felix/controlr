# Controlr

A Ruby on Rails based hosting control panel.

Currently a work in progress as I have the time. It will replace the current
control panel for seconddrawer.com.au.

Currently it supports the following:

- reseller user accounts
- domain user accounts
- email aliases
- email mailboxes

and requires the following:

- postfix
- dovecot
- dovecot IMAP quota (optional)

and _will_ provide the following:

- nice easy 'wizards' to set up common configurations
- tinydns zone generation
- bind zone generation
- nginx config generation
- apache config generation
- client account billing
