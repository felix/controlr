# Controlr

A Ruby on Rails based hosting control panel.

Currently a work in progress as I have the time. It is replacing the current
control panel for seconddrawer.com.au.

Currently it supports the following:

- reseller users
- domain users
- email alias configuration
- email mailbox configuration
- email alias templates per account
- dns record templates per account
- tinydns zone generation

and currently requires the following:

- postfix
- dovecot
- dovecot IMAP quota (optional)

and will eventually provide the following:

- nice easy 'wizards' to set up common configurations
- bind zone generation
- nginx config generation
- apache config generation
- client account billing
- managesieve client
- chrooted SSH configuration

It requires some setup to enable the configuration for each service. Examples
are given in the 'docs' folder for common setups with tinydns and others.
